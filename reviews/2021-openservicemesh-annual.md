## Adoption

> What do you know about adoption, and how has this changed since your last review / since you joined Sandbox? If you can list companies that are end users of your project, please do so. (Feel free to link to an existing ADOPTERS file if appropriate.)

Strong end-user adoption and usage has grown since the OSM project entered into the incubating stage. This adoption has made the OSM project pivot to supporting additional community projects collaborations/integrations such as [Flagger](https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger/blob/main/docs/gitbook/tutorials/osm-progressive-delivery.md), [Contour Ingress](https://release-v0-11.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/demos/ingress_contour/), and [Open Policy Agent](https://release-v0-11.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/integrations/external_auth_opa/), with more in the works.

We continue to grow the community with providing our [Contributor Ladder](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER.md) to make is easy and clear to newcomers how to contribute and grow in status with the project.

## Project Performance

> How has the project performed against its goals since the last review? (We won't penalize you if your goals changed for good reasons.)

This is OSM's first CNCF project review. OSM's main project objectives has been centered the following:

- Delivering a simplified operators experience for service mesh operations
- Building a community that embodies the understanding and need for simple service mesh controls

The core OSM team believes we've made significant progress in these areas. The project will continue to engage the community with through community calls, as well as interactions on issues posted to the GitHub repo.
