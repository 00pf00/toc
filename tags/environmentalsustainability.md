# CNCF TAG Environmental Sustainability

## Introduction

The Paris Climate Accords outline the link between economic activity, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the impacts of climate change. GHG  emissions, primarily made from Carbon Dioxide, are released during the combustion of fossil fuels to produce electricity. To reach net zero goals, we will first identify how to reduce the environmental footprints of increasingly large data centers and then help the community take action to mitigate these footprints.

## Mission Statement
This TAG's goal is to advocate for, develop, support, and help evaluate environmental sustainability initiatives in Cloud Native Technologies.  We will identify values and possible incentives for service providers to reduce their consumption and carbon footprint through cloud native tooling.

All activities of this TAG should aim to identify values and possible incentives for service providers to reduce their consumption and carbon footprint through cloud native tooling.

## Responsibilities & Deliverables

### Background
We recognize that: 
- the trade off between reducing resource consumption and higher performance is hard to balance
- there is a lack of well supported and documented benchmarks for evaluating cloud native projects in their default or optimized configurations

### In-Scope

- Identify, define, and develop tooling to assess and improve environmental sustainability approaches, including
    - Quantify the energy consumption of cloud native projects individually as well as in common integration patterns.
    - recommendations to manage full-stack software such that the overall energy consumption and associated carbon are reduced.
    - items to evaluate technological and architectural health of projects
- Community outreach on any items within scope, for instance, social media/conferences/podcasts/meetups et cetera
- Collaboration with other sustainability efforts

### Out of scope
- Form an umbrella organization beyond the CNCF
- Establish a compliance and standards body beyond the CNCF space
- Evaluate individual company infrastructures
- Focus outside of Cloud Native Technologies, according to the [CNCF Cloud Native definition](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md)

## Deliverables to ToC
- Landscape for carbon and energy efficiency in the form of metrics, measurements, and management techniques
- Provide environmental sustainment recommendations and optimizations to new and existing projects within the landscape and areas of gap in the environmental sustainment coverage of the landscape
- Review upcoming project proposed for adoption and propose to CNCF according to interest
- Regularly report to ToC on ongoing and completed work
- Recommend projects for inclusion into the CNCF
- Suggestions for improvements for CNCF internal processes, for example, education for sustainability

## Audiences

- Education - audience is end users, developers, stakeholders
- Project intelligence - audience is TOC/CNCF Community
- External collaboration - organizations with the same mindset

#### Operations

Environmental Sustainability TAG operations are consistent with standard TAG operating guidelines provided by the [CNCF Technical Oversight Committee TOC](https://github.com/cncf/toc).
